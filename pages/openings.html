		<h2>Invocation</h2>
		<hr>
		<h3>Description</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>A one word suggestion is gotten from the audience, usually an object.</li>
			<li>The cast "summons" the object with a specifically formatted incantation</li>
			<li>In each phase cast members step out, point towards the imagined object center stage, or use another manner of taking focus before delivering their line of the incantation.</li>
			<li>About 10-20 ideas(2-3 per cast member) should be shared in each phase except the final phase.</li>
			<li><em>IT IS</em></li>
			<ul>
				<li>In the <em>it is</em> phase the object is treated as a person.</li>
				<li>Cast members state </li>
				<li></li>
			</ul>
			<li><em>YOU ARE</em></li>
			<ul>
				<li>In the <em>you are</em> phase the object is treated as a thing.</li>
				<li>Cast members talk directly to the object giving it a personal nature or human characteristics.</li>
				<li>Add on to other cast members ideas from the previous phase to help establish group mind and help memerable ideas rise to the top.</li>
			</ul>
			<li><em>THOU ART</em></li>
			<ul>
				<li>In the <em>thou art</em> phase the object is treated as a god.</li>
				<li>To endow the object with godlike qualities the cast members should deliver their lines with the energy and gravitas of a shakespearean actor.</li>
				<li>The cast members are essentially worshiping the object now.</li>
				<li>The cast members should return to ideas from the preious phases abstracting and distilling them for the upcoming scenes.</li>
			</ul>
			<li><em>I AM</em></li>
			<ul>
				<li>In the <em>I am</em> phase cast members become the object.</li>
				<li>Each cast member should speak only once in this phase.</li>
				<li>Don't introduce any new ideas in this phase.</li>
				<li>Ideally the cast is creating a list of their best ideas here at the end</li>
				<li>Once every cast member has said their <em>I am</em> line, they all say together "I am (the obect)!"</li>
			</ul>
		</ul><hr>
