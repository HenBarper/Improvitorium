	<!-- ---------- BAD RAP ---------- -->
	<div class="game-box p-2" id="badRap">
		<h2>Bad Rap</h2>
		<hr>
		<h3>Description</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Players stand in a circle and snap, clap, or pat a rhythm.</li>
			<li>Everyone chants together in rhythm: bad rap _ bad rap _ bad rap bad rap _ bad rap _ bad rap.</li>
			<li>The first player raps a line, establishing the rhyming word.</li>
			<li>Everyone chants together between each line.</li>
			<li>The next player raps a line setting up an obvious rhyme for the last word of the previous line but then chooses a non rhyming word to end the line.</li>
			<li>The next player in the circle uses the last word of the previous line to set up an obvious rhyme but then again doesn't go for it.</li>
			<li>Continue the pattern as long as your group likes!</li>
		</ul><hr>
		<h3>Example</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Group: bad rap _ bad rap _ bad rap bad rap _ bad rap _ bad rap</li>
			<li>Player 1: I sure would like to eat a snack!</li>
			<li>Player 2: (thinking of the rhyme pack) I always stick together with my wolf <strong>crew!</strong></li>
			<li>Group: bad rap _ bad rap _ bad rap bad rap _ bad rap _ bad rap</li>
			<li>Player 3: (thinking of the rhyme dew) I love the grass in the morning covered in <strong>wet!</strong></li>
			<li>Group: bad rap _ bad rap _ bad rap bad rap _ bad rap _ bad rap</li>
			<li>Player 4: (thinking of the rhyme debt) I have bag credit because I'm in <strong>finance bad!</strong></li>
			<li>Group: bad rap _ bad rap _ bad rap bad rap _ bad rap _ bad rap</li>
			<li>etc...</li>
		</ul><hr>
		<h3>Variations</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Have the next person finish your line with the non-rhyming word.</li>
			<li>Example:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Group: bad rap _ bad rap _ bad rap bad rap _ bad rap _ bad rap</li>
				<li>Player 1: I sure would like to eat a snack!</li></li>
				<li>Group: bad rap _ bad rap _ bad rap bad rap _ bad rap _ bad rap</li>
				<li>Player 2: (thinking of the rhyme pack) I always stick together with my wolf...</li>
				<li>Player 3: <strong>crew!</strong></li>
				<li>Group: bad rap _ bad rap _ bad rap bad rap _ bad rap _ bad rap</li>
			</ul>
		</ul><hr>
		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Try to set up the next person with an easy word to rhyme. Single syllable words are usually safe.</li>
			<li>As soon as you hear the person before you's end word, think of a rhyme, then build up to it and pick a different word at the last second.</li>
			<li>Synonyms are usually the way to ge, but a curveball can be fun too.</li>

		<h2>Day in the Life</h2>
		<hr>
		<h3>Instructions</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>An audience volunteer is selected to tell the story of their day, or alternatively you could ask for a specific type of story.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Best day of your life</li>
				<li>For a theme show: your craziest New Years Eve story</li>
			</ul>
			<li>The interviewer or backline should feel free to ask clarifying questions or to ask for more details if the story teller is a little more timid.</li>
			<li>After the interview, the ensemble will perform this persons day.</li>
			<li>The goal is not to recreate the story as is, the goal is to use the characters, ideas, situations, and general structure from the story to create a fun scene.</li>
		</ul><hr>
		<h3>Purpose</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The interview section will force improvisers to listen intently.</li>
			<li>This is a good exercise to teach the basics of premise based long form, like listening for specifcs in an opening and bringing them into a scene.</li>
		</ul><hr>
		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Members from the backline should feel free to become inanimate objects in sections of the scene where there are no secondary characters present.</li>
			<li>Don't be overly indulgent in the interview section, we don't want to alienate the audience member by constantly interupting them for jokes. The improvisers can be funny during the scene.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>It will also make the whole setup and scene take a really long time.</li>

	<!-- ---------- SENTENCE GAME ---------- -->
	<div class="game-box p-2" id="sentenceGame">
		<h2>Sentence Game</h2>
		<hr>
		<h3>Description</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Before the show have audience members write sentences on strips of paper.</li>
			<li>These can be random silly sentences, song lyrics, lines from movies, pick-up lines, or anything else!</li>
			<li>Set up a basic scene with a suggestion or use one of the variations below, then pass out 3-4 sentence strips to the improvisers.</li>
			<li>The improvisers will perform a scene, occasionally pulling out a sentence strip and reading it as their dialogue.</li>
			<li>The improvisers must then justify the line they just said.</li>
			<li>The scene continues until the host edits, usually after they've used all their sentence strips.</li>
		</ul><hr>
		<h3>Example</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Improviser 1: I love the sound of rain outside.</li>
			<li>Improviser 2: Yeah I feel so peacful.</li>
			<li>Improviser 1 pulls out a sentence strip</li>
			<li>Improviser 1: Get rid out it, now!</li>
			<li>Improviser 2: What?! Get rid of what?!</li>
			<li>Improviser 1: There's spinach in your teeth! It's making me sick!</li>
		</ul><hr>
		<h3>Purpose</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>A great exercise in listening and justification.</li>
			<li>Usually a real crowd pleaser, audience members are excited to hear the dialogue they wrote, and it's always funny to see the cast react to the out of no where line they've just said and try to justify it.</li>
		</ul><hr>
		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>It's usually best to just pull out a strip and read it without any prompting like "My grampa always told me..." or "That makes me think of the time..."</li>
			<li>Don't read the strip immediately, give the scene a few lines back and forth to establish the base reality and a bit of the character first.</li>
			<li>You can have someone(not someone who will be performing in these scenes) pre read the sentences to make sure there isn't anything problematic.</li>
			<li>Either way make sure the improvisers know they can omit anything from their strip they deem problematic or are uncomfortable saying.</li>
		</ul><hr>
		<h3>Variations</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Pick-up lines</li>
				<ul>
				<li>Have the audience members write pick-up lines on the strips.</li>
				<li>Designate 2-3 improvisers to be the ones the pickup-ees and the others will get the sentence strips and be the pickup-ers</li>
				<li>You can say they're at a bar or get a suggestion for where these pick-ups are happening.</li>
				<li>The pickup-ers will take turns shooting their shot, coming up to talk to the pickup-ees, delivering their pick-up lines, and getting rejected.</li>
				<li>It's fun if by the end, at least one of the pick-up lines works and that pair leave together.</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Eulogy</li>
				<ul>
				<li>Get an audience member to volunteer their name, the improvisers will be attending their funeral.</li>
				<li>We designate the front center stage to be where the open casket is located.</li>
				<li>The improvisers will approach in groups of 2 or 3, mix and matching performers each time they come back.</li>
				<li>They will be playing the dead persons, friends, family, co workers, etc... Talking and sharing stories about the person using their sentence strips as inspiration.</li>
				</ul>
			<li>These are just couple variations we play, there are infinite possibilities so make up and experiment with your own.</li>

			<li>The narrator speaks aloud what he is "writing".</li>
			<li>Improvisers will enter the scene to play the characters the narrator mentions and begin playing the scene normally.</li>
			<li>The narrator can give and take focus at any time.</li>

		<h3>Example</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Narrator: The mystery of the missing moose. Chapter one, the forest sleeps. A cool chill hung in the early morning air as Park Ranger Mitchel and his young apprentice Carl began their morning forest inspection hike.</li>
			<li>Two improvisers step out miming preparing for their walk.</li>
			<li>Carl: It's freezing out here Mr. Mitchel. Maybe we go back and sit around the fire until it warms up a bit.</li>
			<li>Ranger Mitchel: I'm sure everything's fine Carl. But it's our responsibility to make sure all the forest creatures are safe from anyone who would do them harm.</li>
			<li>Narrator: But everything wasn't fine in the forest that day, and it wouldn't be long before the ranger noticed something out of the ordinary.</li>
			<li>Ranger Mitchel: Oh my god. Freeze boy.</li>
			<li>Carl: Why? What is it Mr. Mitchel?</li>
			<li>Ranger Mitchel: You see that? It's a moose egg. Not usualy for them to be left alone like that. Momma's gotta be nearby.</li>
			<li>Narrator: A large, brown, and furry egg lay nestled in a bed of pine needles surrounded by trees in every direction. A trail of crimson staining the forest floor lay before them leading into the thickest brush of the woods.</li>
			<li>Carl: Wait... Mr. Mitchel. Is that blood?</li>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Be sure improvisers are using give and take to share the spotlight. The bulk of the responsibility shouldn't fall on the narrator or the actors.</li>
			<li>The narrator can take advantage of the format by establishing tone and using scene painting.</li>
			<li>Yes and the narrators decisions including the physical reality of the space.</li>
			<li>The narrator can always jump forward in time, to a new location or rip up a page and start over. They don't have to write the story in sequential order.</li>
			<li>Focus on telling a good story rather than doing bits. Bits can have their place though.</li>
