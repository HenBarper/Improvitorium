		<h2>Change</h2>
		<hr>
		<h3>Description</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Two improvisers start a scene and a third acts as a host.</li>
			<li>The host will ring a bell or say a phrase like change! or new decision! periodically after a line of dialogue has been said.</li>
			<li>The improviser who said that last line of dialogue will have to say a new line of dialogue to replace it.</li>
		</ul><hr>
		<h3>Example</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Improviser 1: What do you want?</li>
			<li>Improviser 2: I want a muffin.</li>
			<li>Host: Change!</li>
			<li>Improviser 2: I want a whole cake to myself.</li>
			<li>Host: Change!</li>
			<li>Improviser 2: I want you to love me again!</li>
		</ul><hr>
		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Try to heighten each time you are made to change a line of dialogue and go for a drastic change on the third changed line.</li>
			<li>As the host, utilize the rule of three most of the time, only occasionally making the improvisers change only one line of dialogue or making them change many lines in a long run of changes.</li>
		</ul><hr>

		<h2>Half Life</h2>
		<hr>
		<h3>Description</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The host sets up the game. Two improvisers will perform an entire story in just one minute. They can riff a little about how movies today are too long, people don't have long attention spans or whatever.</li>
			<li>The host then gets a suggestion. It could be an existing story or movie title, a made up title, a genre, or any basic suggestion.</li>
			<li>The two improviers then perform that scene, trying to create the entire story in one minute. The host will time them and call scene at one minute.</li>
			<li>Then the host will point out that it's still too long and set them up to do the same scene in half the time.</li>
			<li>This pattern continues doing the same scene in half the time going from 60 to 30 to 15 to 7 to 3 to 1 second(s).</li>
			<li>Each time the scene is replayed it's distilled and/or sped up further until the final one second scene.</li>
		</ul><hr>
		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Try to move around the stage and use object work to help you remember the flow of what happens in the original scene.</li>
			<li>It probably won't be an extremely compelling narrative but try to have a beginning, middle, and end.</li>
			<li>Play up dramatic and film tropes.</li>
		</ul><hr>
