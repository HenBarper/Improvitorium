	<!-- ---------- BEASTIE BOYS ---------- -->
	<div class="game-box p-2" id="beastieBoys">
		<h2>Beastie Boys</h2>
		<hr>
		<h3>Description</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Two teams of 3-4 players will face off in a pseudo rap battle.</li>
			<li>Each team has a leader who sets up rhymes and supporters who try to complete the rhyme in time with a beat.</li>
			<li>Instruct the audience to make a buzzer sound if the team fails to complete the rhyme in a way that makes sense or is too off beat.</li>
			<li>To start each round, the host will get a one word suggestion.</li>
			<li>The two leaders will go back and fourth trying to set up their team to complete their rhyme with the suggested word.</li>
			<li>If the support players fail to complete the rhyme appropriately the leader is eliminated and rotates to the back to become a supporter and a new leader steps forward, which starts a new round.</li>
			<li>The team who won the previous round will go first in the next round.</li>
			<li>A team loses when all their members have been eliminated as the leader.</li>
		</ul><hr>
		<h3>Example</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Suggestion: Day</li>
			<li>Team 1 Leader: Little kids at recess, they love to...</li>
			<li>Team 1 Support: PLAY!</li>
			<li>Team 2 Leader: I sure don't curse, those aren't words that I...</li>
			<li>Team 2 Support: SAY!</li>
			<li>Team 1 Leader: I don't know where I am, I don't know which...</li>
			<li>Team 1 Support: ... uhhh... Oh! WAY!(way too late off beat)</li>
			<li>Audience: *buzzer sound*</li>
			<li>Team 1 rotates and a new round beings.</li>
		</ul><hr>
		<h3>Purpose</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>This game is great for practicing rhyming, getting in a rhyming mindset, and setting up others to finish rhymes.</li>
			<li>It's a great warm-up or show opener.</li>
		</ul><hr>
		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Really bring that energy and spirit of competion to this game. Feel free to dis the other team or act like their rhymes are whack.</li>
			<li>The host should ask the audience for one or two syllable words unless the performers are very skilled at rhyming.</li>
			<li>If it is helpful a leader can do an act out as part or their set up.</li>
			<li>The beat can be played by a percussion, a looping backing track, or by having the performers snap, clap, or pat. But a track or percussionist is preferred for a live performance.</li>

	<!-- ---------- HALF LIFE ---------- -->
	<div class="game-box p-2" id="halfLife">
		<h2>Half Life</h2>
		<hr>
		<h3>Description</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The host sets up the game. Two improvisers will perform an entire story in just one minute. They can riff a little about how movies today are too long, people don't have long attention spans or whatever.</li>
			<li>The host then gets a suggestion. It could be an existing story or movie title, a made up title, a genre, or any basic suggestion.</li>
			<li>The two improviers then perform that scene, trying to create the entire story in one minute. The host will time them and call scene at one minute.</li>
			<li>Then the host will point out that it's still too long and set them up to do the same scene in half the time.</li>
			<li>This pattern continues doing the same scene in half the time going from 60 to 30 to 15 to 7 to 3 to 1 second(s).</li>
			<li>Each time the scene is replayed it's distilled and/or sped up further until the final one second scene.</li>
		</ul><hr>
		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Try to move around the stage and use object work to help you remember the flow of what happens in the original scene.</li>
			<li>It probably won't be an extremely compelling narrative but try to have a beginning, middle, and end.</li>
			<li>Play up dramatic and film tropes.</li>
