		<h2>Day in the Life</h2>
		<hr>
		<h3>Instructions</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>An audience volunteer is selected to tell the story of their day, or alternatively you could ask for a specific type of story.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Best day of your life</li>
				<li>For a theme show: your craziest New Years Eve story</li>
			</ul>
			<li>The interviewer or backline should feel free to ask clarifying questions or to ask for more details if the story teller is a little more timid.</li>
			<li>After the interview, the ensemble will perform this persons day.</li>
			<li>The goal is not to recreate the story as is, the goal is to use the characters, ideas, situations, and general structure from the story to create a fun scene.</li>
		</ul><hr>
		<h3>Purpose</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The interview section will force improvisers to listen intently.</li>
			<li>This is a good exercise to teach the basics of premise based long form, like listening for specifcs in an opening and bringing them into a scene.</li>
		</ul><hr>
		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Members from the backline should feel free to become inanimate objects in sections of the scene where there are no secondary characters present.</li>
			<li>Don't be overly indulgent in the interview section, we don't want to alienate the audience member by constantly interupting them for jokes. The improvisers can be funny during the scene.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>It will also make the whole setup and scene take a really long time.</li>
			</ul>

	<!-- ---------- TYPEWRITER ---------- -->
	<div class="game-box p-2" id="typewriter">
		<h2>Typewriter</h2>
		<hr>
		<h3>Description</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>One player is the narrator of the story and sits or stands on stage miming like they are writing a story on a typewriter.</li>
			<li>The narrator speaks aloud what he is "writing".</li>
			<li>Improvisers will enter the scene to play the characters the narrator mentions and begin playing the scene normally.</li>
			<li>The narrator can give and take focus at any time.</li>
		</ul><hr>
		<h3>Example</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Narrator: The mystery of the missing moose. Chapter one, the forest sleeps. A cool chill hung in the early morning air as Park Ranger Mitchel and his young apprentice Carl began their morning forest inspection hike.</li>
			<li>Two improvisers step out miming preparing for their walk.</li>
			<li>Carl: It's freezing out here Mr. Mitchel. Maybe we go back and sit around the fire until it warms up a bit.</li>
			<li>Ranger Mitchel: I'm sure everything's fine Carl. But it's our responsibility to make sure all the forest creatures are safe from anyone who would do them harm.</li>
			<li>Narrator: But everything wasn't fine in the forest that day, and it wouldn't be long before the ranger noticed something out of the ordinary.</li>
			<li>Ranger Mitchel: Oh my god. Freeze boy.</li>
			<li>Carl: Why? What is it Mr. Mitchel?</li>
			<li>Ranger Mitchel: You see that? It's a moose egg. Not usualy for them to be left alone like that. Momma's gotta be nearby.</li>
			<li>Narrator: A large, brown, and furry egg lay nestled in a bed of pine needles surrounded by trees in every direction. A trail of crimson stained staining the forest floor lay before them leading into the thickest brush of the woods.</li>
			<li>Carl: Wait... Mr. Mitchel. Is that blood?</li>
		</ul><hr>
		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Be sure improvisers are using give and take to share the spotlight. The bulk of the responsibility shouldn't fall on the narrator or the actors.</li>
			<li>The narrator can take advantage of the format by establishing tone and using scene painting.</li>
			<li>Yes and the narrators decisions including the physical reality of the space.</li>
			<li>The narrator can always jump forward in time, to a new location or rip up a page and start over. They don't have to write the story in sequential order.</li>
			<li>Focus on telling a good story rather than doing bits. Bits can have their place though.</li>
