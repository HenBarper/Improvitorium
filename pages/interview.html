		<h2>Day in the Life</h2>
		<hr>
		<h3>Instructions</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>An audience volunteer is selected to tell the story of their day, or alternatively you could ask for a specific type of story.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Best day of your life</li>
				<li>For a theme show: your craziest New Years Eve story</li>
			</ul>
			<li>The interviewer or backline should feel free to ask clarifying questions or to ask for more details if the story teller is a little more timid.</li>
			<li>After the interview, the ensemble will perform this persons day.</li>
			<li>The goal is not to recreate the story as is, the goal is to use the characters, ideas, situations, and general structure from the story to create a fun scene.</li>
		</ul><hr>
		<h3>Purpose</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The interview section will force improvisers to listen intently.</li>
			<li>This is a good exercise to teach the basics of premise based long form, like listening for specifcs in an opening and bringing them into a scene.</li>
		</ul><hr>
		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Members from the backline should feel free to become inanimate objects in sections of the scene where there are no secondary characters present.</li>
			<li>Don't be overly indulgent in the interview section, we don't want to alienate the audience member by constantly interupting them for jokes. The improvisers can be funny during the scene.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>It will also make the whole setup and scene take a really long time.</li>
			</ul>
		</ul><hr>

	<!-- ---------- PING PONG BALLAD ---------- -->
	<div class="game-box p-2" id="pingPongBallad">
		<h2>Ping Pong Ballad</h2>
		<hr>
		<h3>Description</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>This is a game for two improvisers.</li>
			<li>A volunteer from the audience is invited to sit center stage.</li>
			<li>The two improvisers conduct a brief interview of the audience member. Get their name, family, pets, occupation, hobbies, etc...</li>
			<li>Instruct the audience member that whoever they are looking at during the song has to be singing, they can switch back and forth between who they are looking at as much as they want, and to use and abuse this power.</li>
			<li>The music comes in and who ever is being looked at must serenade the audience member.</li>
			<li>The improviers will need to listen intently while the other is singing so they can continue any lines are are interupted with a switch.</li>
		</ul><hr>
		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>If you get switched to mid word or phrase, do your best to finish that word or phrase.</li>
			<li>Use the persons name often. It's a good reset or start of a line or verse.</li>
			<li>Better yet if you can set up rhymes with their name.</li>
		</ul><hr>
