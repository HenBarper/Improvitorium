		<h2>Day in the Life</h2>
		<hr>
		<h3>Instructions</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>An audience volunteer is selected to tell the story of their day, or alternatively you could ask for a specific type of story.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Best day of your life</li>
				<li>For a theme show: your craziest New Years Eve story</li>
			</ul>
			<li>The interviewer or backline should feel free to ask clarifying questions or to ask for more details if the story teller is a little more timid.</li>
			<li>After the interview, the ensemble will perform this persons day.</li>
			<li>The goal is not to recreate the story as is, the goal is to use the characters, ideas, situations, and general structure from the story to create a fun scene.</li>
		</ul><hr>
		<h3>Purpose</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The interview section will force improvisers to listen intently.</li>
			<li>This is a good exercise to teach the basics of premise based long form, like listening for specifcs in an opening and bringing them into a scene.</li>
		</ul><hr>
		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Members from the backline should feel free to become inanimate objects in sections of the scene where there are no secondary characters present.</li>
			<li>Don't be overly indulgent in the interview section, we don't want to alienate the audience member by constantly interupting them for jokes. The improvisers can be funny during the scene.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>It will also make the whole setup and scene take a really long time.</li>
			</ul>
		</ul><hr>
