	<!-- ---------- CHANGE ---------- -->
	<div class="game-box p-2" id="change">
		<h2>Change</h2>
		<hr>
		<h3>Description</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Two improvisers start a scene and a third acts as a host.</li>
			<li>The host will ring a bell or say a phrase like change! or new decision! periodically after a line of dialogue has been said.</li>
			<li>The improviser who said that last line of dialogue will have to say a new line of dialogue to replace it.</li>
		</ul><hr>
		<h3>Example</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Improviser 1: What do you want?</li>
			<li>Improviser 2: I want a muffin.</li>
			<li>Host: Change!</li>
			<li>Improviser 2: I want a whole cake to myself.</li>
			<li>Host: Change!</li>
			<li>Improviser 2: I want you to love me again!</li>
		</ul><hr>
		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Try to heighten each time you are made to change a line of dialogue and go for a drastic change on the third changed line.</li>
			<li>As the host, utilize the rule of three most of the time, only occasionally making the improvisers change only one line of dialogue or making them change many lines in a long run of changes.</li>

	<!-- ---------- CHARACTER PANEL ---------- -->
	<div class="game-box p-2" id="characterPanel">
		<h2>Character Panel</h2>
		<hr>
		<h3>Description</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Three improvisers take a seat or stand on stage.</li>
			<li>A host welcomes the crowd to this special event where we have a panel of experts and gets a suggestion for the topic on which they are experts.</li>
			<li>Optionally the host can give the improvisers a chance to introduce themselves as their characters</li>
			<li>The host fields questions from the audience and lets the characters go down the line and answer them.</li>
			<li>The host can make some observations or inferences about the characters in between their answers and questions but shouldn't take up too much time talking themself.</li>
		</ul><hr>
		<h3>Purpose</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Improvisers are able to make up a character and explore their perspective without worrying about other elements of scenework.</li>
			<li>Improviers will have to listen to their scene partners and make decisions that are distinct from them.</li>
		</ul><hr>
		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Answers to questions should last too long, this isn't a monologue.</li>
			<li>Improvisers need to make sure their characters are very distinct from each other and have unique perspectives on the topic.</li>
			<li>Commit fully to their characters or this game will get boring real quick.</li>
			<li>The host should moderate the amount of questions based on how long they take to get through each character, usually 2-4 questions is best.</li>
			<li>Let a different character answer first in each round of questions.</li>

	<!-- ---------- TAXI ---------- -->
	<div class="game-box p-2" id="taxi">
		<h2>Taxi</h2>
		<hr>
		<h3>Description</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>One improviser is selected to be the taxi driver and guesser. They leave the room while the host or participating improvisers get suggestions.</li>
			<li>3-6 other improvisers will be the cab riders. They will get suggestions for distinct characters to play.</li>
			<li>They can be cartoon characters, celebrities, innanimate objects, animals or anything else that can be played for comedic effect.</li>
			<li>Once all the suggestions are gotten, we can call back in the driver to start the scene.</li>
			<li>They'll mime starting off their day and soon pick up the first rider.</li>
			<li>The rider will give hints to the driver based on their behavior and answers to the cab driver's questions.</li>
			<li>Once the driver has an idea who they think the person might be they can begin guessing.</li>
			<li>Once they guess correctly they can drop off the rider and pick up the next.</li>
		</ul><hr>
		<h3>Purpose</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>This is a fun game to play with improvisers of all skill levels.</li>
			<li>The driver must listen and pay close attention to the character to try and guess who they are.</li>
			<li>New improvisers are forced to step outside themself and play a character.</li>
		</ul><hr>
		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The rider's hints should start out relatively vague and get more obvious over time so as not to give it away too quickly, or spend too much time on one character.</li>
			<li>If it seems like the driver really can't get it feel free after some time to just give it up with a rhyme - "You really don't know me? It rhymes with picky pouse!"</li>
			<li>If you're playing with only 2-3 passengers, or a particularly good guesser, feel free to give them a secondary characteristic after their character like...</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Spongebob Sqaurepants selling tupperware</li>
				<li>A blender whose dog ran away</li>
				<li>A thunderstorm with a crush on John Cena</li>
				<li>A praying mantis who is obsessed with reality tv</li>
