		<h2>Organic Long Form</h2>
		<hr>
		<h3>Description</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>This format is without any real structure.</li>
			<li>A suggestion can be gotten at the top or the set can begin completely organically.</li>
			<li>If a suggestion is gotten at the top, that will inspire the initiation for the first scene.</li>
			<li>Each scene will be initiated based off something organically pulled from the improvisers mind, or from an element from the scene the preceeded it.</li>
			<li>Improvisers can use any support moves or edits available to them to play the scenes before moving on to the next.</li>
			<li>The scenes do not have to have any through line or connections.</li>
		</ul><hr>
		<h3>Purpose</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Doing organic sets is a great way to practice finding and playing game organically.</li>
		</ul><hr>
		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Try to add variety to your scenes by varying them in length, number of performers per scene and energy level.</li>

	<!-- ---------- TYPEWRITER ---------- -->
	<div class="game-box p-2" id="typewriter">
		<h2>Typewriter</h2>
		<hr>
		<h3>Description</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>One player is the narrator of the story and sits or stands on stage miming like they are writing a story on a typewriter.</li>
			<li>The narrator speaks aloud what he is "writing".</li>
			<li>Improvisers will enter the scene to play the characters the narrator mentions and begin playing the scene normally.</li>
			<li>The narrator can give and take focus at any time.</li>
		</ul><hr>
		<h3>Example</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Narrator: The mystery of the missing moose. Chapter one, the forest sleeps. A cool chill hung in the early morning air as Park Ranger Mitchel and his young apprentice Carl began their morning forest inspection hike.</li>
			<li>Two improvisers step out miming preparing for their walk.</li>
			<li>Carl: It's freezing out here Mr. Mitchel. Maybe we go back and sit around the fire until it warms up a bit.</li>
			<li>Ranger Mitchel: I'm sure everything's fine Carl. But it's our responsibility to make sure all the forest creatures are safe from anyone who would do them harm.</li>
			<li>Narrator: But everything wasn't fine in the forest that day, and it wouldn't be long before the ranger noticed something out of the ordinary.</li>
			<li>Ranger Mitchel: Oh my god. Freeze boy.</li>
			<li>Carl: Why? What is it Mr. Mitchel?</li>
			<li>Ranger Mitchel: You see that? It's a moose egg. Not usualy for them to be left alone like that. Momma's gotta be nearby.</li>
			<li>Narrator: A large, brown, and furry egg lay nestled in a bed of pine needles surrounded by trees in every direction. A trail of crimson staining the forest floor lay before them leading into the thickest brush of the woods.</li>
			<li>Carl: Wait... Mr. Mitchel. Is that blood?</li>
		</ul><hr>
		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Be sure improvisers are using give and take to share the spotlight. The bulk of the responsibility shouldn't fall on the narrator or the actors.</li>
			<li>The narrator can take advantage of the format by establishing tone and using scene painting.</li>
			<li>Yes and the narrators decisions including the physical reality of the space.</li>
			<li>The narrator can always jump forward in time, to a new location or rip up a page and start over. They don't have to write the story in sequential order.</li>
			<li>Focus on telling a good story rather than doing bits. Bits can have their place though.</li>
