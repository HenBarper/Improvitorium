	<!-- ---------- BAD RAP ---------- -->
	<div class="game-box p-2" id="badRap">
		<h2>Bad Rap</h2>
		<hr>
		<h3>Description</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Players stand in a circle and snap, clap, or pat a rhythm.</li>
			<li>Everyone chants together in rhythm: bad rap _ bad rap _ bad rap bad rap _ bad rap _ bad rap.</li>
			<li>The first player raps a line, establishing the rhyming word.</li>
			<li>Everyone chants together between each line.</li>
			<li>The next player raps a line setting up an obvious rhyme for the last word of the previous line but then chooses a non rhyming word to end the line.</li>
			<li>The next player in the circle uses the last word of the previous line to set up an obvious rhyme but then again doesn't go for it.</li>
			<li>Continue the pattern as long as your group likes!</li>
		</ul><hr>
		<h3>Example</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Group: bad rap _ bad rap _ bad rap bad rap _ bad rap _ bad rap</li>
			<li>Player 1: I sure would like to eat a snack!</li>
			<li>Player 2: (thinking of the rhyme pack) I always stick together with my wolf <strong>crew!</strong></li>
			<li>Group: bad rap _ bad rap _ bad rap bad rap _ bad rap _ bad rap</li>
			<li>Player 3: (thinking of the rhyme dew) I love the grass in the morning covered in <strong>wet!</strong></li>
			<li>Group: bad rap _ bad rap _ bad rap bad rap _ bad rap _ bad rap</li>
			<li>Player 4: (thinking of the rhyme debt) I have bag credit because I'm in <strong>finance bad!</strong></li>
			<li>Group: bad rap _ bad rap _ bad rap bad rap _ bad rap _ bad rap</li>
			<li>etc...</li>
		</ul><hr>
		<h3>Variations</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Have the next person finish your line with the non-rhyming word.</li>
			<li>Example:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Group: bad rap _ bad rap _ bad rap bad rap _ bad rap _ bad rap</li>
				<li>Player 1: I sure would like to eat a snack!</li></li>
				<li>Group: bad rap _ bad rap _ bad rap bad rap _ bad rap _ bad rap</li>
				<li>Player 2: (thinking of the rhyme pack) I always stick together with my wolf...</li>
				<li>Player 3: <strong>crew!</strong></li>
				<li>Group: bad rap _ bad rap _ bad rap bad rap _ bad rap _ bad rap</li>
			</ul>
		</ul><hr>
		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Try to set up the next person with an easy word to rhyme. Single syllable words are usually safe.</li>
			<li>As soon as you hear the person before you's end word, think of a rhyme, then build up to it and pick a different word at the last second.</li>
			<li>Synonyms are usually the way to ge, but a curveball can be fun too.</li>

	<div class="game-box p-2" id="beastieBoys">
		<h2>Beastie Boys</h2>
		<hr>
		<h3>Description</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Two teams of 3-4 players will face off in a pseudo rap battle.</li>
			<li>Each team has a leader who sets up rhymes and supporters who try to complete the rhyme in time with a beat.</li>
			<li>Instruct the audience to make a buzzer sound if the team fails to complete the rhyme in a way that makes sense or is too off beat.</li>
			<li>To start each round, the host will get a one word suggestion.</li>
			<li>The two leaders will go back and fourth trying to set up their team to complete their rhyme with the suggested word.</li>
			<li>If the support players fail to complete the rhyme appropriately the leader is eliminated and rotates to the back to become a supporter and a new leader steps forward, which starts a new round.</li>
			<li>The team who won the previous round will go first in the next round.</li>
			<li>A team loses when all their members have been eliminated as the leader.</li>
		</ul><hr>
		<h3>Example</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Suggestion: Day</li>
			<li>Team 1 Leader: Little kids at recess, they love to...</li>
			<li>Team 1 Support: PLAY!</li>
			<li>Team 2 Leader: I sure don't curse, those aren't words that I...</li>
			<li>Team 2 Support: SAY!</li>
			<li>Team 1 Leader: I don't know where I am, I don't know which...</li>
			<li>Team 1 Support: ... uhhh... Oh! WAY!(way too late off beat)</li>
			<li>Audience: *buzzer sound*</li>
			<li>Team 1 rotates and a new round beings.</li>
		</ul><hr>
		<h3>Purpose</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>This game is great for practicing rhyming, getting in a rhyming mindset, and setting up others to finish rhymes.</li>
			<li>It's a great warm-up or show opener.</li>
		</ul><hr>
		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Really bring that energy and spirit of competion to this game. Feel free to dis the other team or act like their rhymes are whack.</li>
			<li>The host should ask the audience for one or two syllable words unless the performers are very skilled at rhyming.</li>
			<li>If it is helpful a leader can do an act out as part or their set up.</li>
			<li>The beat can be played by a percussion, a looping backing track, or by having the performers snap, clap, or pat. But a track or percussionist is preferred for a live performance.</li>
