		<h2>60 Seconds of Silence</h2>
		<hr>
		<h3>Description</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Two improvisers take the stage.</li>
			<li>A suggestion is given.</li>
			<li>They strike a pose then hold it and wait.</li>
			<li>After 60 seconds the teacher calls start and the scene begins.</li>
		</ul><hr>
		<h3>Purpose</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>In the beginning you'll be thinking of many different ideas and dropping them, thinking about the other person, and shifting your posture slightly.</li>
			<li>As you near the 60 second mark that panic will settle and you'll have nothing but a general idea of the dynamic between you and your partner.</li>
			<li>By the time the scene starts you should be ready to listen intently to your scene partner.</li>

			<li>Everyone chants together in rhythm: bad rap _ bad rap _ bad rap bad rap _ bad rap _ bad rap.</li>
			<li>The first player raps a line, establishing the rhyming word.</li>
			<li>Everyone chants together between each line.</li>
			<li>The next player raps a line setting up an obvious rhyme for the last word of the previous line but then chooses a non rhyming word to end the line.</li>
			<li>The next player in the circle uses the last word of the previous line to set up an obvious rhyme but then again doesn't go for it.</li>
			<li>Continue the pattern as long as your group likes!</li>
		</ul><hr>
		<h3>Example</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Group: bad rap _ bad rap _ bad rap bad rap _ bad rap _ bad rap</li>
			<li>Player 1: I sure would like to eat a snack!</li>

				<li>Player 3: <strong>crew!</strong></li>
				<li>Group: bad rap _ bad rap _ bad rap bad rap _ bad rap _ bad rap</li>
			</ul>
		</ul><hr>
		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Try to set up the next person with an easy word to rhyme. Single syllable words are usually safe.</li>
			<li>As soon as you hear the person before you's end word, think of a rhyme, then build up to it and pick a different word at the last second.</li>
			<li>Synonyms are usually the way to ge, but a curveball can be fun too.</li>

	<!-- ---------- CHARACTER PANEL ---------- -->
	<div class="game-box p-2" id="characterPanel">
		<h2>Character Panel</h2>
		<hr>
		<h3>Description</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Three improvisers take a seat or stand on stage.</li>
			<li>A host welcomes the crowd to this special event where we have a panel of experts and gets a suggestion for the topic on which they are experts.</li>
			<li>Optionally the host can give the improvisers a chance to introduce themselves as their characters</li>
			<li>The host fields questions from the audience and lets the characters go down the line and answer them.</li>
			<li>The host can make some observations or inferences about the characters in between their answers and questions but shouldn't take up too much time talking themself.</li>
		</ul><hr>
		<h3>Purpose</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Improvisers are able to make up a character and explore their perspective without worrying about other elements of scenework.</li>
			<li>Improviers will have to listen to their scene partners and make decisions that are distinct from them.</li>
		</ul><hr>
		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Answers to questions should last too long, this isn't a monologue.</li>
			<li>Improvisers need to make sure their characters are very distinct from each other and have unique perspectives on the topic.</li>
			<li>Commit fully to their characters or this game will get boring real quick.</li>
			<li>The host should moderate the amount of questions based on how long they take to get through each character, usually 2-4 questions is best.</li>
			<li>Let a different character answer first in each round of questions.</li>

			<li>Improvisers form a circle.</li>
			<li>One improviser will cross the circle to approach another improviser and initiate a 3-4 line scene with them.</li>
			<li>The initiating improviser will make a strong character choice, embracing the physicality, characteristics, and voice of that character as they approach and initiate.</li>
			<li>The improviser who was approached will take on the same physicality, characteristics, and voice as the approaching improviser and respond to their initiation.</li>
			<li>They should take on the same characteristics even if the approaching improviser makes it clear in their initiating line that they are not the same type of character(see example below).</li>
			<li>After 3-4 lines total the inititating improviser will take the place of the other improviser, who will now approach someone else in the circle as a new character and initate a new 3-4 lines scene.</li>
			<li>Go until everyone has had a turn to both initiate and respond to an initiation.</li>
		</ul><hr>
		<h3>Example</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Different declared characters but matching anyway</li>

		<h2>Day in the Life</h2>
		<hr>
		<h3>Instructions</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>An audience volunteer is selected to tell the story of their day, or alternatively you could ask for a specific type of story.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Best day of your life</li>
				<li>For a theme show: your craziest New Years Eve story</li>
			</ul>
			<li>The interviewer or backline should feel free to ask clarifying questions or to ask for more details if the story teller is a little more timid.</li>
			<li>After the interview, the ensemble will perform this persons day.</li>
			<li>The goal is not to recreate the story as is, the goal is to use the characters, ideas, situations, and general structure from the story to create a fun scene.</li>
		</ul><hr>
		<h3>Purpose</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The interview section will force improvisers to listen intently.</li>
			<li>This is a good exercise to teach the basics of premise based long form, like listening for specifcs in an opening and bringing them into a scene.</li>
		</ul><hr>
		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Members from the backline should feel free to become inanimate objects in sections of the scene where there are no secondary characters present.</li>
			<li>Don't be overly indulgent in the interview section, we don't want to alienate the audience member by constantly interupting them for jokes. The improvisers can be funny during the scene.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>It will also make the whole setup and scene take a really long time.</li>

		<h2>Talk About Something Else</h2>
		<hr>
		<h3>Description</h3>

		<h2>Typewriter</h2>

		<h3>Description</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>One player is the narrator of the story and sits or stands on stage miming like they are writing a story on a typewriter.</li>
			<li>The narrator speaks aloud what he is "writing".</li>
			<li>Improvisers will enter the scene to play the characters the narrator mentions and begin playing the scene normally.</li>
			<li>The narrator can give and take focus at any time.</li>
		</ul><hr>
		<h3>Example</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Narrator: The mystery of the missing moose. Chapter one, the forest sleeps. A cool chill hung in the early morning air as Park Ranger Mitchel and his young apprentice Carl began their morning forest inspection hike.</li>
			<li>Two improvisers step out miming preparing for their walk.</li>
			<li>Carl: It's freezing out here Mr. Mitchel. Maybe we go back and sit around the fire until it warms up a bit.</li>
			<li>Ranger Mitchel: I'm sure everything's fine Carl. But it's our responsibility to make sure all the forest creatures are safe from anyone who would do them harm.</li>
			<li>Narrator: But everything wasn't fine in the forest that day, and it wouldn't be long before the ranger noticed something out of the ordinary.</li>
			<li>Ranger Mitchel: Oh my god. Freeze boy.</li>
			<li>Carl: Why? What is it Mr. Mitchel?</li>
			<li>Ranger Mitchel: You see that? It's a moose egg. Not usualy for them to be left alone like that. Momma's gotta be nearby.</li>
			<li>Narrator: A large, brown, and furry egg lay nestled in a bed of pine needles surrounded by trees in every direction. A trail of crimson stained staining the forest floor lay before them leading into the thickest brush of the woods.</li>
			<li>Carl: Wait... Mr. Mitchel. Is that blood?</li>
		</ul><hr>
		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Be sure improvisers are using give and take to share the spotlight. The bulk of the responsibility shouldn't fall on the narrator or the actors.</li>
			<li>The narrator can take advantage of the format by establishing tone and using scene painting.</li>
			<li>Yes and the narrators decisions including the physical reality of the space.</li>
			<li>The narrator can always jump forward in time, to a new location or rip up a page and start over. They don't have to write the story in sequential order.</li>
			<li>Focus on telling a good story rather than doing bits. Bits can have their place though.</li>
