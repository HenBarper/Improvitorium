		<h2>60 Seconds of Silence</h2>
		<hr>
		<h3>Description</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Two improvisers take the stage.</li>
			<li>A suggestion is given.</li>
			<li>They strike a pose then hold it and wait.</li>
			<li>After 60 seconds the teacher calls start and the scene begins.</li>
		</ul><hr>
		<h3>Purpose</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>In the beginning you'll be thinking of many different ideas and dropping them, thinking about the other person, and shifting your posture slightly.</li>
			<li>As you near the 60 second mark that panic will settle and you'll have nothing but a general idea of the dynamic between you and your partner.</li>
			<li>By the time the scene starts you should be ready to listen intently to your scene partner.</li>

	<!-- ---------- CHARACTER PANEL ---------- -->
	<div class="game-box p-2" id="characterPanel">
		<h2>Character Panel</h2>
		<hr>
		<h3>Description</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Three improvisers take a seat or stand on stage.</li>
			<li>A host welcomes the crowd to this special event where we have a panel of experts and gets a suggestion for the topic on which they are experts.</li>
			<li>Optionally the host can give the improvisers a chance to introduce themselves as their characters</li>
			<li>The host fields questions from the audience and lets the characters go down the line and answer them.</li>
			<li>The host can make some observations or inferences about the characters in between their answers and questions but shouldn't take up too much time talking themself.</li>
		</ul><hr>
		<h3>Purpose</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Improvisers are able to make up a character and explore their perspective without worrying about other elements of scenework.</li>
			<li>Improviers will have to listen to their scene partners and make decisions that are distinct from them.</li>
		</ul><hr>
		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Answers to questions should last too long, this isn't a monologue.</li>
			<li>Improvisers need to make sure their characters are very distinct from each other and have unique perspectives on the topic.</li>
			<li>Commit fully to their characters or this game will get boring real quick.</li>
			<li>The host should moderate the amount of questions based on how long they take to get through each character, usually 2-4 questions is best.</li>
			<li>Let a different character answer first in each round of questions.</li>

		<h2>Character Matching</h2>
		<hr>
		<h3>Description</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Improvisers form a circle.</li>
			<li>One improviser will cross the circle to approach another improviser and initiate a 3-4 line scene with them.</li>
			<li>The initiating improviser will make a strong character choice, embracing the physicality, characteristics, and voice of that character as they approach and initiate.</li>
			<li>The improviser who was approached will take on the same physicality, characteristics, and voice as the approaching improviser and respond to their initiation.</li>
			<li>They should take on the same characteristics even if the approaching improviser makes it clear in their initiating line that they are not the same type of character(see example below).</li>
			<li>After 3-4 lines total the inititating improviser will take the place of the other improviser, who will now approach someone else in the circle as a new character and initate a new 3-4 lines scene.</li>
			<li>Go until everyone has had a turn to both initiate and respond to an initiation.</li>
		</ul><hr>
		<h3>Example</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Different declared characters but matching anyway</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Improviser 1: *approaching hunched over, walking with a cane, speaking with an eldery voice* "When I was your age little timmy, baseballs only costs a nickle!"</li>
				<li>Improviser 2: *taking on the same elderly physicality and voice* "Well gee wilikers Mr. Griffordson I can't get a toothpick for that price these days."</li>
				<li>Improviser 1: "That's because the commies!"</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Both characters match the character and perspective</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Improviser 1: *approaching as a twitchy little gremlin* "Ehhhh! Grimble, I'm hungry for human flesh!"</li>
				<li>Improviser 2: *taking on the same physicality* "Yes! I want a skin muffin and a venti blood frappe!"</li>

	<!-- ---------- DAY IN THE LIFE ---------- -->
	<div class="game-box p-2" id="dayInTheLife">
		<h2>Day in the Life</h2>
		<hr>
		<h3>Instructions</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>An audience volunteer is selected to tell the story of their day, or alternatively you could ask for a specific type of story.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Best day of your life</li>
				<li>For a theme show: your craziest New Years Eve story</li>
			</ul>
			<li>The interviewer or backline should feel free to ask clarifying questions or to ask for more details if the story teller is a little more timid.</li>
			<li>After the interview, the ensemble will perform this persons day.</li>
			<li>The goal is not to recreate the story as is, the goal is to use the characters, ideas, situations, and general structure from the story to create a fun scene.</li>
		</ul><hr>
		<h3>Purpose</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The interview section will force improvisers to listen intently.</li>
			<li>This is a good exercise to teach the basics of premise based long form, like listening for specifcs in an opening and bringing them into a scene.</li>
		</ul><hr>
		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Members from the backline should feel free to become inanimate objects in sections of the scene where there are no secondary characters present.</li>
			<li>Don't be overly indulgent in the interview section, we don't want to alienate the audience member by constantly interupting them for jokes. The improvisers can be funny during the scene.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>It will also make the whole setup and scene take a really long time.</li>

		<h2>Talk About Something Else</h2>
		<hr>
		<h3>Description</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>One improviser initiates a scene with some sort of phyical activity.</li>
			<li>The activity should be something that can be continued throughout the scene like washing dishes, folding laundry, decorating for a party, etc...</li>

			<li>Usually you don't talk about doing dishes while you're doing dishes, or most other mundane activities.</li>
			<li>It's more realistic this way.</li>
			<li>This exercise will also help you build your environment and keep the scene dynamic without getting stuck talking about something uninteresting.</li>
