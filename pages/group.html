		<h2>Ad Game</h2>
		<hr>
		<h3>Description</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>An ensemble member comes up with an unusual product by taking an ordinary item and giving it an unusual trait</li>
			<ul>
				<li><em>A car that changes color based on it's surroundings.</em></li>
				<li><em>A refrigerator that is also a radio.</em></li>
			</ul>
			<li>The ensemble works together to create an advertising campaign for an unusual product.</li>
			<li>They will come up with a name, slogan, target demographic, celebrity spokesperson, jingle, etc...</li>
			<li>All the elements of the product should complement each other.</li>
			<li>No matter the idea, the entire group must support and yes and it.</li>
		</ul><hr>
		<h3>Example</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Player 1: "We could call it The Chameleon!"</strong></li>
			<li><strong>Player 2: "Yeah! We could have Meryl Streep as the spokesperson. She could talk about how she disappears into her roles like this car disappears into it's surroundings."</strong></li>
			<li><strong>Player 3: "Yeah! She could start off the commercial as Julia Child and then finish as Margaret Thatcher."</strong></li>
			<li><strong>Player 4: "We could sell it to criminals! If they're being chased by the police, they can blend into their surroundings to hide."</strong></li>
			<li><strong>Player 3: "We could take helicopter footage of a police chase and suddenly, the car disappears, blending into the highway!"</strong></li>
			<li><strong>Player 2: "When you don't want to be seen, this is your machine."</strong></li>
			<li><strong>Player 4: "Great slogan! *Starts to sing* This car's named after a lizard that can hide, buy this car and camouflage your ride!"</strong></li>
		</ul><hr>
		<h3>Purpose</h3>
		<ul>
		<p>Used as an exercise, the ensemble will...</p>
			<li>Practice performing verbal all-at-once group games.</li>
			<li>Strengthen their ability to listen, yes and, and utilize give and take.</li>
